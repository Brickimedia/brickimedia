# ClickTracking lets you track users' clicks on links/buttons.
# The current implementation tracks clicks on the navigation bar - the
# WikiEditor toolbar makes use of this if present

# This extension requires MediaWiki 1.17+ because it makes use of ResourceLoader.

# To track a dynamic action, be sure that $.trackAction( 'something to identify action' ) is called in JS
# To track an action that has state information associated with it, fire $.trackActionWithInfo( 'action', 'state information' );

# Example LocalSettings.php additions

// Track 1 in every 10 clicks; set to 1 to track all clicks, -1 to disable
