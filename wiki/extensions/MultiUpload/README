== WikiHow:MultipleUpload Extension ==

This is a simple extension to upload multiple photos at once. It makes
as much use of Special:Upload as it can. There are some issues when a
warning and an error is encountered in one upload attempt.


=== Requirements ===

* PHP 5.x
* This has been tested on Mediawiki 1.6.7, so it should work on later versions. 


=== Installation ===

Download the extension from here http://www.wikihow.com/x/multipleupload.tar,
in your base Mediawiki directory. It will place SpecialMultipleUpload.php
in your extensions directory.

Add the line

	require_once("extensions/MultiUpload/MultiUpload.php");

to your LocalSettings.php file.


=== Configuration ===

You can change the maximum number of files a user can upload at once by
changing $wgMaxUploadFiles. Then all you have to do is put a link somewhere
to Special:MultipleUpload.
