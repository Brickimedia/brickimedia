Below is a list of all of the updates of the release of this pack.

[27th October 2005]

Wow, I can't believe it's been several years since the last update. Sadly I looked back
at this emoticon pack and was surprised at just how childish my attitude was. Pretty funny
in a strange way though, but it makes me wonder how I even had any friends. Deary me.
Anyway, more to the point, I've updated this pack a little by optimizing emoticons a bit
further and whatnot:

- 10 or so new emoticons added
- Several emoticons made transparent
- The whole pack generally tidied up a bit

Thanks.

Also, I'd just like to point out to y'all that you can check out my website, which is:

www.iPengo.com - I think, therefore iPengo

I hope this emoticon pack has what you need. Peace.

If some of you use the Instant Messaging program 'MSN Messenger', you'll be aware
that there is now a release of MSN 6.0, which gives the option for users to add
their own emoticons for use. These emoticons can be used for MSN Messenger, although
there is a restriction on the image dimensions - 20px by 20px. Many emoticons fit
this criteria although I'm aware that some of the emoticons in this pack are much larger
and therefore unsuitable for use in MSN Messenger.

New emoticons have been added to this pack. Enjoy!
